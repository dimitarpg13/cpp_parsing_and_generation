Quickstart 1: A word counter using Sprit.Lex

Spirit.Lex is very modular, which follows the general building principle of the Spirit libraries.
You never pay for features you don't use. It is nicely integrated with the other parts of Spirit
but nevertheless can be used separately to build standalone lexical analyzers. The first quick
start example describes a stand alone application: counting characters, words, and lines in a file,
very similar to what the well known Unix command ```wc``` is doing.
